# Tab Out (Fork)

**Keep tabs on your tabs.**

> This is a fork of [Tab Out](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/tab-out) by [Zara Zhang](https://x.com/zarazhangrui). The original is a beautifully designed Chrome extension — this fork adds a few tweaks on top.

Tab Out is a Chrome extension that replaces your new tab page with a dashboard of everything you have open. Tabs are grouped by domain, with homepages (Gmail, X, LinkedIn, etc.) pulled into their own group. Close tabs with a satisfying swoosh + confetti.

No server. No account. No external API calls. Just a Chrome extension.

## Fork Changes

- **Browser internal tabs** (`chrome://`, `about:`, etc.) are now shown in a "Browser" group instead of hidden
- **Debug mode** — small toggle icon in the top-right reveals the raw domain key for each group
- **Refresh button** — re-reads your open tabs without opening a new tab
- **Google homepage** added to the Homepages landing page group

---

## Install with a coding agent

Send your coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) this repo and say **"install this"**:

```
https://github.com/ziikki/tab-out
```

The agent will walk you through it. Takes about 1 minute.

## How it works

```
You open a new tab
  -> Tab Out shows your open tabs grouped by domain
  -> Homepages (Gmail, X, etc.) get their own group at the top
  -> Click any tab title to jump to it
  -> Close groups you're done with (swoosh + confetti)
  -> Save tabs for later before closing them
```

Everything runs inside the Chrome extension. No external server, no API calls, no data sent anywhere. Saved tabs are stored in `chrome.storage.local`.
